  <pre>Return to sender
Return to sender

I gave a letter to the postman
He put it in his sack
Bright early next morning
He brought my letter back

Return to sender, address unknown
No such number, no such zone
We had a quarrel, a lover&#39;s spat
I write I&#39;m sorry, but my letter keeps coming back

So then I dropped it in the mailbox
And sent it special D
Bright and early next morning
It came right back to me

Return to sender, address unknown
No such person, no such zone

This time I&#39;m gonna take it myself and put it right in her hand
And if it comes back the very next day then I&#39;ll understand

Return to sender, address unknown
No such number, no such zone

Return to sender
Return to sender
Return to sender
Return to sender...
