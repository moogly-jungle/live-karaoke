  <pre>Like the legend of the phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning
The force from the beginning

We&#39;ve come too far, to give up who we are
So let&#39;s raise the bar and our cups to the stars

She&#39;s up all night to the sun,
I&#39;m up all night to get some
She&#39;s up all night for good fun
I&#39;m up all night to get lucky

We&#39;re up all night to the sun,
we&#39;re up all night to get some
We&#39;re up all night for good fun
we&#39;re up all night to get lucky
We&#39;re up all night to get lucky
we&#39;re up all night to get lucky
We&#39;re up all night to get lucky
we&#39;re up all night to get lucky

The present has no ribbon
Your gift keeps on giving
What is this I&#39;m feeling?
If you want to leave, I&#39;m with it

We&#39;ve come too far, to give up who we are
So let&#39;s raise the bar and our cups to the stars

She&#39;s up all night to the sun,
I&#39;m up all night to get some
She&#39;s up all night for good fun
I&#39;m up all night to get lucky

We&#39;re up all night to the sun,
we&#39;re up all night to get some
We&#39;re up all night for good fun
we&#39;re up all night to get lucky
We&#39;re up all night to get lucky
we&#39;re up all night to get lucky
We&#39;re up all night to get lucky
we&#39;re up all night to get lucky

We&#39;ve come too far, to give up who we are
So let&#39;s raise the bar and our cups to the stars

She&#39;s up all night to the sun,
I&#39;m up all night to get some
She&#39;s up all night for good fun
I&#39;m up all night to get lucky

We&#39;re up all night to the sun,
we&#39;re up all night to get some
We&#39;re up all night for good fun
we&#39;re up all night to get lucky
We&#39;re up all night to get lucky
we&#39;re up all night to get lucky
We&#39;re up all night to get lucky
we&#39;re up all night to get lucky

We&#39;re up all night to get lucky
We&#39;re up all night to get lucky
We&#39;re up all night to get lucky
We&#39;re up all night to get lucky
