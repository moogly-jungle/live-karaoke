  <h1>Ain&#39;t no sunshine - Bill Withers</h1>

  <pre>Ain&#39;t no sunshine when she&#39;s gone
It&#39;s not warm when she&#39;s away
Ain&#39;t no sunshine when she&#39;s gone
And she&#39;s always gone too long
Anytime she&#39;s goes away

Wonder this time where she&#39;s gone
Wonder if she&#39;s gone to stay
Ain&#39;t no sunshine when she&#39;s gone
And this house just ain&#39;t no home
Anytime she goes away

And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know

Hey, I ought to leave young thing alone
But ain&#39;t no sunshine when she&#39;s gone, whoa-whoa

Ain&#39;t no sunshine when she&#39;s gone
Only darkness every day
Ain&#39;t no sunshine when she&#39;s gone
And this house just ain&#39;t no home
Anytime she goes away

Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
