    <!--LYRICS-->
    Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
    It's not warm when she's away
    Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
    And she's always gone too long
    Anytime she's goes away
    
    Wonder this time where she's gone
    Wonder if she's gone to stay
    Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
    And this house just ain't no home
    Anytime she goes away
    
    And I know, I know, I know, I know
    I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
    I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
    I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
    I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
    I know, I know
    
    Hey, I ought to leave young thing alone
    But ain't no sunshine when she's gone, whoa-whoa
    
    Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
    Only darkness every day
    Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
    And this house just ain't no home
    Anytime she goes away
    
    Anytime she goes away
    Anytime she goes away
    Anytime she goes away
