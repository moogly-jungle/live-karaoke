  <pre><span class="structure">[Verse 1]
</span>And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I&#39;ll say it clear
I&#39;ll state my case, of which I&#39;m certain
I&#39;ve lived a life that&#39;s full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

<span class="structure">[Verse 2]
</span>Regrets, I&#39;ve had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

<span class="structure">[Chorus]
</span>Yes, there were times, I&#39;m sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all, and I stood tall
And did it my way

<span class="structure">[Verse 3]
</span>I&#39;ve loved, I&#39;ve laughed and cried
I&#39;ve had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, oh, no, not me
I did it my way

<span class="structure">[Chorus]
</span>For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

<span class="structure">[Outro]
</span>Yes, it was my way
