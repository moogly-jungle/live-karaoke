  <pre>At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Thinking I could live without you by my side
And after spending nights
Thinking how you did me wrong
I grew strong
And I learned how to get along

Now you&#39;re back
From outer space
And I find you here
With that sad look upon your face
I should&#39;ve changed that stupid lock
Or made you leave your key
If I&#39;d&#39;ve known for a second
You&#39;d be back to bother me

Go on, go, walk out the door
Turn around now
You&#39;re not welcome anymore
You&#39;re the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Think I&#39;d crumble?
You think I&#39;d lay down and die?

No, not I, I will survive
Long as I know how to love, I know I&#39;ll stay alive
I&#39;ve got my life to live
And all my love to give and
I will survive
I, I, I will survive

It took all my strength not to fall apart
Trying with all my might to mend my broken heart
I spent so many nights feeling sorry for myself
How I cried
But now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
I&#39;m not that lonely little person
Still in love with you
Now you come droppin&#39; in
Expectin&#39; me to be free
Now I&#39;m saving my lovin&#39;
For someone who&#39;s loving me

Go on and go, walk out the door
Turn around now
You&#39;re not welcome anymore
You&#39;re the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Thinkin&#39; I&#39;d crumble
Did you think I&#39;d lay down and die?

No, not I, I will survive
Long as I know how to love, I know I&#39;ll stay alive
I&#39;ve got my life to live, and all my love to give
And I will survive
I, I will survive

Go on, go, walk out the door
Turn around now
You&#39;re not welcome anymore
You&#39;re the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Think I&#39;d crumble?
You think I&#39;d lay down and die?

No, not I, I will survive
Long as I know how to love
I know I&#39;ll stay alive
I&#39;ve got my life to live
And all my love to give and
I will survive
I, I, I will survive
