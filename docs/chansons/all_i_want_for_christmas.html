  <pre>I don&#39;t want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don&#39;t care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
Yeah

I don&#39;t want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (and I)
Don&#39;t care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I don&#39;t need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won&#39;t make me happy with a toy on Christmas Day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, I won&#39;t ask for much this Christmas
I won&#39;t even wish for snow (and I)
I&#39;m just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
I won&#39;t make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won&#39;t even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click

&#39;Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh-oh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere (so brightly, baby)
And the sound of children&#39;s laughter fills the air (oh, oh, yeah)
And everyone is singing (oh, yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won&#39;t you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh)
Won&#39;t you please bring my baby to me?

Oh, I don&#39;t want a lot for Christmas
This is all I&#39;m asking for
I just wanna see my baby standing right outside my door

Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas (all I really want) is you, baby
All I want (I want) for Christmas (all I really want) is you, baby
