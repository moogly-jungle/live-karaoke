    <!--LYRICS-->
    Strumming my pain with his fingers (one time) yeah, yeah
    Singing my life with his words (two times)
    Killing me softly with his song
    Killing me softly with his song
    Telling my whole life with his words
    Killing me softly with his song
    Yeah, yeah, yeah
    I heard he sang a good song (ah-ah), I heard he had a style (he did)
    And so, I came to see him and listen for a while
    And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes
    Strumming my pain with his fingers (one time) (c'mon, c'mon)
    Singing my life with his words (two times)
    Killing me softly with his song
    Killing me softly with his song (c'mon)
    Telling my whole life (that's right, that's right) with his words
    Killing me softly (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) with his song
    Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
    La-la-la-la-la-la (ah, ah)
    Oh, oh-oh-oh (yeah, yeah, yeah)
    La-a-ah
    Oh, oh-oh-oh
    La-a-ah, la-a-ah, la-a-ah (yeah, c'mon) la-a-ah, la-a-ah
    Strumming my pain with his fingers (one time)
    Yes, he was singing my life (two times)
    Killing me softly with his song (that's right)
    Killing me softly with his song
    Telling my whole life with his words
    Killing me softly with his song, yeah-yeah-yeah
