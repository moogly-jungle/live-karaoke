  <h1>Killing Me Softly - Fugees</h1>

  <pre>Strumming my pain with his fingers (one time) yeah, yeah
Singing my life with his words (two times)
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I heard he sang a good song (ah-ah), I heard he had a style (he did)
And so, I came to see him and listen for a while
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes
Strumming my pain with his fingers (one time) (c&#39;mon, c&#39;mon)
Singing my life with his words (two times)
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song (c&#39;mon)
Telling my whole life (that&#39;s right, that&#39;s right) with his words
Killing me softly (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) with his song
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (c&#39;mon, c&#39;mon, c&#39;mon)
La-la-la-la-la-la (ah, ah)
Oh, oh-oh-oh (yeah, yeah, yeah)
La-a-ah
Oh, oh-oh-oh
La-a-ah, la-a-ah, la-a-ah (yeah, c&#39;mon) la-a-ah, la-a-ah
Strumming my pain with his fingers (one time)
Yes, he was singing my life (two times)
Killing me softly with his song (that&#39;s right)
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song, yeah-yeah-yeah
