    <!--LYRICS-->
    Imagine there's no heaven
    It's easy if you try
    No hell below us
    Above us, only sky
    
    Imagine all the people
    Livin' for today
    Ah
    
    Imagine there's no countries
    It isn't hard to do
    Nothing to kill or die for
    And no religion, too
    
    Imagine all the people
    Livin' life in peace
    You
    
    You may say I'm a dreamer
    But I'm not the only one
    I hope someday you'll join us
    And the world will be as one
    
    Imagine no possessions
    I wonder if you can
    No need for greed or hunger
    A brotherhood of man
    
    Imagine all the people
    Sharing all the world
    You
    
    You may say I'm a dreamer
    But I'm not the only one
    I hope someday you'll join us
    And the world will live as one
