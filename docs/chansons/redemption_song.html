  <pre>Old pirates, yes, they rob I
Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the Almighty
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly

Won&#39;t you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
&#39;Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs
Redemption songs

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
&#39;Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Some say it&#39;s just a part of it
We&#39;ve got to fulfill the book

Won&#39;t you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
&#39;Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs
Redemption songs
Redemption songs

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our mind
Whoa, have no fear for atomic energy
&#39;Cause none of them-ah can-ah stop-ah the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Yes, some say it&#39;s just a part of it
We&#39;ve got to fulfill the book

Won&#39;t you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
&#39;Cause all I ever had
Redemption songs

All I ever have
Redemption songs
These songs of freedom
Songs of freedom
