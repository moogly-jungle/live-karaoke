  <h1>Dirty Old Town - Pogues, Ewan MacColl</h1>

  <pre>I met my love by the gasworks wall
Dreamed a dream by the old canal
I kissed my girl by the factory wall
Dirty old town
Dirty old town

Clouds are drifting across the moon
Cats are prowling on their beat
Spring&#39;s a girl from the streets at night
Dirty old town
Dirty old town

I heard a siren from the docks
Saw a train set the night on fire
Smelled the spring on the smoky wind
Dirty old town
Dirty old town

I&#39;m going to make a good sharp axe
Shining steel tempered in the fire
I&#39;ll chop you down like an old dead tree, that&#39;s what they say
Dirty old town
Dirty old town

I met my love by the gasworks wall
Dreamed a dream by the old canal
I kissed my girl by the factory wall
Dirty old town
Dirty old town
Dirty old town
Dirty old town
