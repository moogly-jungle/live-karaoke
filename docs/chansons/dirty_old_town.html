    <!--LYRICS-->
    I met my love by the gasworks wall
    Dreamed a dream by the old canal
    I kissed my girl by the factory wall
    Dirty old town
    Dirty old town
    
    Clouds are drifting across the moon
    Cats are prowling on their beat
    Spring's a girl from the streets at night
    Dirty old town
    Dirty old town
    
    I heard a siren from the docks
    Saw a train set the night on fire
    Smelled the spring on the smoky wind
    Dirty old town
    Dirty old town
    
    I'm going to make a good sharp axe
    Shining steel tempered in the fire
    I'll chop you down like an old dead tree, that's what they say
    Dirty old town
    Dirty old town
    
    I met my love by the gasworks wall
    Dreamed a dream by the old canal
    I kissed my girl by the factory wall
    Dirty old town
    Dirty old town
    Dirty old town
    Dirty old town
