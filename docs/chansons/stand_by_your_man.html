    <!--LYRICS-->
    I've been accused, among other things
    Of doing most of my writing for you ladies
    But I did write a song special for you guys
    Don't go away feeling slighted
    This is special for you
    
    Sometimes it's hard to be a woman
    Giving all your love to just one man
    You'll have bad times, and he'll have good times
    Doin' things that you don't understand
    
    But if you love him, you'll forgive him
    Even though he's hard to understand
    And if you love him, oh, be proud of him
    'Cause after all, he's just a man
    
    Stand by your man
    Give him two arms to cling to
    And something warm to come to
    When nights are cold and lonely
    
    Stand by your man
    And show the world you love him
    Keep giving all the love you can
    Stand by your man
    
    Stand by your man
    And show the world you love him
    Keep giving all the love you can
    Stand by your man
    
    Your man
