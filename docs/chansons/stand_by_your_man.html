  <h1>Stand by your man - Tammy Wynette</h1>

  <pre>I&#39;ve been accused, among other things
Of doing most of my writing for you ladies
But I did write a song special for you guys
Don&#39;t go away feeling slighted
This is special for you

Sometimes it&#39;s hard to be a woman
Giving all your love to just one man
You&#39;ll have bad times, and he&#39;ll have good times
Doin&#39; things that you don&#39;t understand

But if you love him, you&#39;ll forgive him
Even though he&#39;s hard to understand
And if you love him, oh, be proud of him
&#39;Cause after all, he&#39;s just a man

Stand by your man
Give him two arms to cling to
And something warm to come to
When nights are cold and lonely

Stand by your man
And show the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can
Stand by your man

Stand by your man
And show the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can
Stand by your man

Your man
