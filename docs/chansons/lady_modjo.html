    Lady
    Hear me tonight
    'Cause my feeling
    Is just so right
    As we dance
    By the moonlight
    Can't you see
    You're my delight
    
    Lady
    I just feel like
    I won't get you
    Out of my mind
    I feel love
    For the first time
    And I know that it's true
    I can tell by the look in your eyes
    
    Lady
    Hear me tonight
    'Cause my feeling
    Is just so right
    As we dance
    By the moonlight
    Can't you see
    You're my delight
    
    Lady
    I just feel like
    I won't get you
    Out of my mind
    I feel love
    For the first time
    And I know that it's true
    I can tell by the look in your eyes
    
    Lady
    Hear me tonight
    'Cause my feeling
    Is just so right
    As we dance
    By the moonlight
    Can't you see
    You're my delight
    
    Lady
    I just feel like
    I won't get you
    Out of my mind
    I feel love
    For the first time
    And I know that it's true
    I can tell by the look in your eyes
    
    Lady
    Hear me tonight
    'Cause my feeling
    Is just so right
    Lately
    I just feel like
    I feel love
    For the first time
    
    Lady
    Hear me tonight
    Can't you see
    You're my delight
