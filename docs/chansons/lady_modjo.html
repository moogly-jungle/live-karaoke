  <pre>Lady
Hear me tonight
&#39;Cause my feeling
Is just so right
As we dance
By the moonlight
Can&#39;t you see
You&#39;re my delight

Lady
I just feel like
I won&#39;t get you
Out of my mind
I feel love
For the first time
And I know that it&#39;s true
I can tell by the look in your eyes

Lady
Hear me tonight
&#39;Cause my feeling
Is just so right
As we dance
By the moonlight
Can&#39;t you see
You&#39;re my delight

Lady
I just feel like
I won&#39;t get you
Out of my mind
I feel love
For the first time
And I know that it&#39;s true
I can tell by the look in your eyes

Lady
Hear me tonight
&#39;Cause my feeling
Is just so right
As we dance
By the moonlight
Can&#39;t you see
You&#39;re my delight

Lady
I just feel like
I won&#39;t get you
Out of my mind
I feel love
For the first time
And I know that it&#39;s true
I can tell by the look in your eyes

Lady
Hear me tonight
&#39;Cause my feeling
Is just so right
Lately
I just feel like
I feel love
For the first time

Lady
Hear me tonight
Can&#39;t you see
You&#39;re my delight
