  <pre><span class="structure">[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
</span>Build the fire and gather &#39;round the tree
Fill the glass and maybe come and sing with me

<span class="structure">[Instrumental Break]
</span>
<span class="structure">[Chorus: Ed Sheeran &amp; Elton John]
</span>So kiss me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let&#39;s toast and pray for December snow
I know there&#39;s been pain this year, but it&#39;s time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas

We&#39;ll dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We&#39;ve both known love, but this love we got is the bеst of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes, then you would know
My God, you look bеautiful
Right now, Merry Christmas

<span class="structure">[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran &amp; Elton John]
</span>The fire is raging on
And we&#39;ll all sing along to the song
Just having so much fun
While we&#39;re here, can we all spare a thought for the ones who have gone?
Merry Christmas, everyone

<span class="structure">[Refrain: Choir]
</span>Ah
Ah

<span class="structure">[Chorus: Ed Sheeran &amp; Elton John]
</span>So just keep kissin&#39; me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let&#39;s toast and pray for December snow
I know there&#39;s been pain this year, but it&#39;s time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas

We&#39;ll dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We&#39;ve both known love, but this love we got is the best of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes, then you would know
My God, you look beautiful
Right now, Merry Christmas

<span class="structure">[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran &amp; Elton John]
</span>I feel it when it comes
Every year helpin&#39; us carry on
Filled up with so much love

All our family and friends are together where we all belong
Merry Christmas, everyone

<span class="structure">[Refrain: Choir]
</span>Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah

<span class="structure">[Outro: Ed Sheeran &amp; Elton John, Choir]
</span>It&#39;s Christmas time for you and I (Ah)
We&#39;ll have a good night and a Merry Christmas (Ah)
It&#39;s Christmas time for you and I (Ah)
We&#39;ll have a good night and a Merry Christmas (Ah)
It&#39;s Christmas time for you and I (Ah)
We&#39;ll have a good night and a Merry Christmas (Ah)
It&#39;s Christmas time for you and I (Ah)
We&#39;ll have a good night and a Merry Christmas time
