  <pre>Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I&#39;m begging of you please don&#39;t take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don&#39;t take him just because you can

Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green

Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

He talks about you in his sleep
And there&#39;s nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene

And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don&#39;t know what he means to me, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I&#39;m begging of you please don&#39;t take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don&#39;t take him just because you can

You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He&#39;s the only one for me, Jolene

I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I&#39;m begging of you please don&#39;t take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don&#39;t take him even though you can
Jolene, Jolene
