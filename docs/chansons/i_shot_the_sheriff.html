  <h1>I Shot The Sheriff - Bob Marley</h1>
  
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGO8HN1QQdI">YouTube</a>
  
  <pre>(I shot the sheriff, but I didn&#39;t shoot no deputy, oh no, oh
I shot the sheriff, but I didn&#39;t shoot no deputy, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Yeah, all around in my home town
They&#39;re tryin&#39; to track me down
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy
For the life of a deputy, but I say

Oh, now, now, oh
(I shot the sheriff) the sheriff
(But I swear it was in self defense) oh, no (oh, oh, ooh)
Yeah, I say, I shot the sheriff oh, Lord (and they say it is a capital offense)
Yeah (oh, oh, ooh) yeah

Sheriff John Brown always hated me
For what, I don&#39;t know
Every time I plant a seed
He said kill it before it grow
He said kill them before they grow, and so

Read it in the news (I shot the sheriff) oh, Lord
(But I swear it was in self-defense)
Where was the deputy? (oh, oh, ooh)
I say, I shot the sheriff
But I swear it was in self defense, yeah (ooh)

Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town, yeah
All of a sudden I saw sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down
So I shot, I shot, I shot him down and I say
If I am guilty I will pay

(I shot the sheriff) but I say (but I didn&#39;t shoot no deputy)
I didn&#39;t shoot no deputy (oh, no-oh) oh no
(I shot the sheriff) I did
But I didn&#39;t shoot no deputy, oh (oh, oh, ooh)

Reflexes had got the better of me
And what is to be must be
Every day the bucket a-go a well
One day the bottom a-go drop out
One day the bottom a-go drop out, I say

I, I, I, I, shot the sheriff
Lord, I didn&#39;t shot the deputy, no
I, I (shot the sheriff)
But I didn&#39;t shoot no deputy, yeah
So, yeah
