  <pre><span class="structure">[Verse 1]
</span>Don&#39;t play that song for me
&#39;Cause it brings back memories
Of days that I once knew
The days that I spent with you
Oh, no, don&#39;t let them play it (Oh, no)
It fills my heart with pain (It hurts)
Please stop it right away
&#39;Cause I remember just a&#39; what he said

<span class="structure">[Chorus]
</span>He said, darling (Darling I, I love you)
And I know that he lied (Darling I, I love you)
You know that you lied (Darling I, I love you)
You know that you lied (You lied), lied (You lied), you lied (To me)
Hey, mister, don&#39;t play it no more
Don&#39;t play it no more, I can&#39;t stand it
Don&#39;t play it no more (No more), no more (No more), no more (Can&#39;t stand it)

<span class="structure">[Verse 2]
</span>I remember on our first date
He kissed me and he walked away
I was only seventeen
I never dreamed he&#39;d be so mean

<span class="structure">[Chorus]
</span>He told me darling (Darling, I love you)
Baby, baby, you lied (Darling, I need you)
You, you lied (Darling, I love you)
You know that you lied (You lied), lied (You lied), lied, lied, lied
(To me)

<span class="structure">[Outro]
</span>Oh oh oh, darling (Darling, I love you)
You know that you lied, yeah (Darling, I need you)
You know I know you lied (Darling, I love you)
Darling, you lied (You lied), you lied (You lied), you lied, you&#39;re all that I need, you lied (To me)
Oh oh oh, you lied (Don&#39;t play it no more)

Hey, baby, don&#39;t play it no more (Woah oh oh, don&#39;t play it no more)
Don&#39;t do it. Don&#39;t play it no more (Woah oh oh, for me)
No more (For me)
I can&#39;t stand it no more (Don&#39;t play it no more)
Oh hey don&#39;t play it no more (Woah oh oh, don&#39;t play it no more)
