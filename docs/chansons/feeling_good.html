    <!--LYRICS-->
    Birds flying high, you know how I feel
    Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
    Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel
    
    It's a new dawn, it's a new day
    It's a new life, for me
    And I'm feeling good
    I'm feeling good
    
    Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
    River running free, you know how I feel
    Blossom on a tree, you know how I feel
    
    It's a new dawn, it's a new day
    It's a new life, for me
    And I'm feeling good
    
    Dragonfly out in the sun
    You know what I mean, don't you know?
    Butterflies all havin' fun
    You know what I mean
    Sleep in peace when day is done, that’s what I mean
    
    And this old world is a new world
    And a bold world, for me
    For me!
    
    Stars, when you shine, you know how I feel
    Scent of the pine, you know how I feel
    Oh, freedom is mine, and I know how I feel
    
    It's a new dawn, it’s a new day
    It's a new life
    It's a new dawn, it’s a new day
    It's a new life
    It's a new dawn, it’s a new day
    It's a new life
    It's a new life for me
    And I'm feeling good
    
    [Outro]
    I'm feeling good
    I feel so good
    I feel so good
