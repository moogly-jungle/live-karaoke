  <pre>Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin&#39; on by, you know how I feel

It&#39;s a new dawn, it&#39;s a new day
It&#39;s a new life, for me
And I&#39;m feeling good
I&#39;m feeling good

Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River running free, you know how I feel
Blossom on a tree, you know how I feel

It&#39;s a new dawn, it&#39;s a new day
It&#39;s a new life, for me
And I&#39;m feeling good

Dragonfly out in the sun
You know what I mean, don&#39;t you know?
Butterflies all havin&#39; fun
You know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done, that’s what I mean

And this old world is a new world
And a bold world, for me
For me!

Stars, when you shine, you know how I feel
Scent of the pine, you know how I feel
Oh, freedom is mine, and I know how I feel

It&#39;s a new dawn, it’s a new day
It&#39;s a new life
It&#39;s a new dawn, it’s a new day
It&#39;s a new life
It&#39;s a new dawn, it’s a new day
It&#39;s a new life
It&#39;s a new life for me
And I&#39;m feeling good

</span>I&#39;m feeling good
I feel so good
I feel so good
