  <h1>The Man I Love - Ella Fitzgerald</h1>
  
    <a href="https://youtu.be/iAEzl62bNDM">YouTube</a>
  
  <pre><span class="structure">[Verse 1]
</span>Someday he&#39;ll come along
The man I love
And he&#39;ll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I&#39;ll do my best to make him stay

<span class="structure">[Verse 2]
</span>He&#39;ll look at me and smile
I&#39;ll understand
And in a little while
He&#39;ll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won&#39;t say a word

<span class="structure">[Bridge]
</span>Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I&#39;m sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

<span class="structure">[Verse 3]
</span>He&#39;ll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I&#39;ll never roam
Who would? Would you?
And so all else above
I&#39;m waiting for the man I love

<span class="structure">[Instrumental Break]
</span>
<span class="structure">[Verse 3]
</span>He&#39;ll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I&#39;ll never roam
Who would? Would you?
And so all else above
I&#39;m waiting for the man I love
