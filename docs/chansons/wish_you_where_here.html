    <!--LYRICS-->
    So, so you think you can tell
    Heaven from hell?
    Blue skies from pain?
    Can you tell a green field
    From a cold steel rail?
    A smile from a veil?
    Do you think you can tell?
    
    Did they get you to trade
    Your heroes for ghosts?
    Hot ashes for trees?
    Hot air for a cool breeze?
    Cold comfort for change?
    Did you exchange
    A walk-on part in the war
    For a lead role in a cage?
    
    How I wish, how I wish you were here
    We're just two lost souls
    Swimming in a fishbowl
    Year after year
    Running over the same old ground
    What have we found?
    The same old fears
    Wish you were here
