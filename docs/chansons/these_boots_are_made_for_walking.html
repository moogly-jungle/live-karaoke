    <!--LYRICS-->
    You keep saying you got something for me
    Something you call love, but confess
    You've been a messin' where you shouldn't have been a messin'
    And now someone else is getting all your best
    
    These boots are made for walkin'
    And that's just what they'll do
    One of these days, these boots are gonna walk all over you
    
    Yeah
    
    You keep lyin' when you ought to be truthin'
    You keep losin' when you ought to not bet
    You keep samin' when you ought to be a changin'
    Now what's right is right, but you ain't been right yet
    
    These boots are made for walkin'
    And that's just what they'll do
    One of these days, these boots are gonna walk all over you
    
    You keep playin' where you shouldn't be playin'
    And you keep thinking that you'll never get burnt, ha
    I've just found me a brand new box of matches, yeah
    And what he knows you ain't had time to learn
    
    These boots are made for walkin'
    And that's just what they'll do
    One of these days, these boots are gonna walk all over you
    
    Are you ready, boots?
    Start walking
