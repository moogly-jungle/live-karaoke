  <pre>You keep saying you got something for me
Something you call love, but confess
You&#39;ve been a messin&#39; where you shouldn&#39;t have been a messin&#39;
And now someone else is getting all your best

These boots are made for walkin&#39;
And that&#39;s just what they&#39;ll do
One of these days, these boots are gonna walk all over you

Yeah

You keep lyin&#39; when you ought to be truthin&#39;
You keep losin&#39; when you ought to not bet
You keep samin&#39; when you ought to be a changin&#39;
Now what&#39;s right is right, but you ain&#39;t been right yet

These boots are made for walkin&#39;
And that&#39;s just what they&#39;ll do
One of these days, these boots are gonna walk all over you

You keep playin&#39; where you shouldn&#39;t be playin&#39;
And you keep thinking that you&#39;ll never get burnt, ha
I&#39;ve just found me a brand new box of matches, yeah
And what he knows you ain&#39;t had time to learn

These boots are made for walkin&#39;
And that&#39;s just what they&#39;ll do
One of these days, these boots are gonna walk all over you

Are you ready, boots?
Start walking
