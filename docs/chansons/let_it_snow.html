  <h1>Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! - F. Sinatra, D. Martin</h1>

  <pre><span class="structure">[Couplet 1]
</span>Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we&#39;ve no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

<span class="structure">[Couplet 2]
</span>Man, it doesn&#39;t show signs of stoppin&#39;
And I&#39;ve brought me some corn for poppin&#39;
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow

<span class="structure">[Refrain]
</span>When we finally kiss goodnight
How I&#39;ll hate goin&#39; out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home, I&#39;ll be warm

<span class="structure">[Couplet 3]
</span>And the fire is slowly dyin&#39;
And, my dear, we&#39;re still goodbyein&#39;
But as long as you&#39;d love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow

<span class="structure">[Instrumental]
</span>
<span class="structure">[Refrain]
</span>When we finally kiss goodnight
How I&#39;ll hate goin&#39; out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home, I&#39;ll be warm

<span class="structure">[Couplet 3]
</span>Oh, the fire is slowly dyin&#39;
And, my dear, we&#39;re still goodbyein&#39;
But as long as you&#39;d love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
