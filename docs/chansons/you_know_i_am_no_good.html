  <h1>You Know I&#39;m No Good - Amy Winehouse</h1>

  <pre>Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, &#34;What did you do it with him today?&#34;
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray

Cause you&#39;re my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I&#39;m out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you, I was trouble
You know that I&#39;m no good

Upstairs in bed with my ex boy
Heâ€™s in the place but I can&#39;t get joy
Thinking of you in the final throes 
This is when my buzzer goes

Run out to meet you, chips and Pita
You say &#34;When we&#39;re married&#34; cause you&#39;re not bitter
There&#39;ll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you, I was trouble
You know that I&#39;m no good

<span class="structure">[Chorus]
</span>
Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We&#39;re like how we were again
I&#39;m in the tub, You on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet

Then you notice little carpet burn 
My stomach drops and my guts churn
You shrug and it&#39;s the worst 
to truly stuck the knife in first

I cheated myself like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble, you know that I&#39;m no good
I cheated myself, like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble, yeah, You know that I&#39;m no good
