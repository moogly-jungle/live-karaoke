  <pre>Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper &#34;I love you&#34;
Birds singing in the sycamore trees
Dream a little dream of me, yes

Say &#34;Nighty-night&#34; and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you&#39;ll miss me
While I&#39;m alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me, yeah

Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
I&#39;m longin&#39; to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this, yes

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams, whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me, yeah

Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
I&#39;m longing to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this, yes

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams, whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me, yes
Dream a little dream of me
