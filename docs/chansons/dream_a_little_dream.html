    <!--LYRICS-->
    Stars shining bright above you
    Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you"
    Birds singing in the sycamore trees
    Dream a little dream of me, yes
    
    Say "Nighty-night" and kiss me
    Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
    While I'm alone and blue as can be
    Dream a little dream of me, yeah
    
    Stars fading but I linger on dear
    Still craving your kiss
    I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear
    Just saying this, yes
    
    Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
    Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
    But in your dreams, whatever they be
    Dream a little dream of me, yeah
    
    Stars fading but I linger on dear
    Still craving your kiss
    I'm longing to linger till dawn dear
    Just saying this, yes
    
    Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
    Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
    But in your dreams, whatever they be
    Dream a little dream of me, yes
    Dream a little dream of me
