    <!--LYRICS-->
    There is a house in New Orleans
    They call the Rising Sun
    And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
    Dear God, I know I was one
    
    My mother was a tailor
    She sewed my new blue jeans
    And my father was a gamblin' man
    Way down in New Orleans
    
    And the only thing a gambler needs
    Is a suitcase and a trunk
    And the only time he's satisfied
    Is when he's a drunk
    
    Oh, mother, tell your children
    Not to do what I have done
    To spend your lives in sin and misery
    In the house of the rising sun
    
    I got one foot on the platform
    And another on the train
    And I'm going back to New Orleans
    To wear that ball and chain
    
    [Instrumental]

    Dear God, I know I was one
    Dear God, I know I was the one
