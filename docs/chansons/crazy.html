    <!--LYRICS-->
    I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
    There was something so pleasant about that place.
    Even your emotions had an echo
    In so much space
    
    And when you're out there
    Without care,
    Yeah, I was out of touch
    But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
    I just knew too much
    
    Does that make me crazy?
    Does that make me crazy?
    Does that make me crazy?
    Probably
    
    And I hope that you are having the time of your life
    But think twice, that's my only advice
    
    --
    
    Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are,
    Ha ha ha bless your soul
    You really think you're in control
    
    Well, I think you're crazy
    I think you're crazy
    I think you're crazy
    Just like me
    
    My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
    And all I remember is thinking, I want to be like them
    
    --
    
    Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
    And it's no coincidence I've come
    And I can die when I'm done
    
    Maybe I'm crazy
    Maybe you're crazy
    Maybe we're crazy
    Probably
    
    Uh, uh
