  <h1>Crazy - Gnarls Barkley</h1>

  <pre>I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place.
Even your emotions had an echo
In so much space

And when you&#39;re out there
Without care,
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn&#39;t because I didn&#39;t know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Probably

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that&#39;s my only advice

--

Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are,
Ha ha ha bless your soul
You really think you&#39;re in control

Well, I think you&#39;re crazy
I think you&#39;re crazy
I think you&#39;re crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember is thinking, I want to be like them

--

Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
And it&#39;s no coincidence I&#39;ve come
And I can die when I&#39;m done

Maybe I&#39;m crazy
Maybe you&#39;re crazy
Maybe we&#39;re crazy
Probably

Uh, uh
