  <h1>Can&#39;t Help Falling In Love - Elvis Presley</h1>

  <pre>Wise men say, only fools rush in   
but I can&#39;t help, falling in love with you
Shall I stay, would it be a sin     
If I can&#39;t help, falling in love with you

Like a river flows, surely to the sea
darling so it goes
some things are meant to be

Take my hand, take my whole life too
for I can&#39;t help, falling in love with you

Like a river flows, surely to the sea
darling so it goes
some things are meant to be

Take my hand, take my whole life too
for I can&#39;t help, falling in love with you
