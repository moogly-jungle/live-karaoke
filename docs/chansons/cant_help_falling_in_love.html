    <!--LYRICS-->
    Wise men say, only fools rush in
    but I can't help, falling in love with you
    Shall I stay, would it be a sin
    If I can't help, falling in love with you
    
    Like a river flows, surely to the sea
    darling so it goes
    some things are meant to be
    
    Take my hand, take my whole life too
    for I can't help, falling in love with you
    
    Like a river flows, surely to the sea
    darling so it goes
    some things are meant to be
    
    Take my hand, take my whole life too
    for I can't help, falling in love with you
