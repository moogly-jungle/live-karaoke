    <!--LYRICS-->
    My name is Luka
    I live on the second floor
    I live upstairs from you
    Yes, I think you've seen me before
    
    If you hear something late at night
    Some kind of trouble, some kind of fight
    Just don't ask me what it was
    Just don't ask me what it was
    Just don't ask me what it was
    
    I think it's 'cause I'm clumsy
    I try not to talk too loud
    Maybe it's because I'm crazy
    I try not to act too proud
    
    They only hit until you cry
    After that you don't ask why
    You just don't argue anymore
    Just don't argue anymore
    Just don't argue anymore
    
    Yes, I think I'm okay
    I walked into the door again
    Well, if you ask that's what I'll say
    It's not your business anyway
    I guess I'd like to be alone
    With nothing broken, nothing thrown
    Just don't ask me how I am
    Just don't ask me how I am
    Just don't ask me how I am
    
    My name is Luka
    I live on the second floor
    I live upstairs from you
    Yes, I think you've seen me before
    
    If you hear something late at night
    Some kind of trouble, some kind of fight
    Just don't ask me what it was
    Just don't ask me what it was
    Just don't ask me what it was
    
    Only hit until you cry
    After that, you don't ask why
    You just don't argue anymore
    You just don't argue anymore
    You just don't argue anymore
