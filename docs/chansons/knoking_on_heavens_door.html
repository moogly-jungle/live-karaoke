    Mama take this badge from me
    I can't use it anymore
    It's getting dark too dark to see
    Feels like I'm knockin' on Heaven's door
    
    Knock-knock-knockin' on Heaven's door
    Knock-knock-knockin' on Heaven's door
    Knock-knock-knockin' on Heaven's door
    Knock-knock-knockin' on Heaven's door
    
    Mama put my guns in the ground
    I can't shoot them anymore
    That cold black cloud is comin' down
    Feels like I'm knockin' on Heaven's door
    
    Knock-knock-knockin' on Heaven's door
    Knock-knock-knockin' on Heaven's door
    Knock-knock-knockin' on Heaven's door
    Knock-knock-knockin' on Heaven's door
    
    "You just better start sniffin' your own rank subjugation jack
    'Cause it's just you against your tattered libido
    The bank and the mortician, forever man
    And it wouldn't be luck if you could get out of life alive"
    
    Knock-knock-knockin' on Heaven's door
    (Knock-knock-knockin' on Heaven's door)
    Knock-knock-knockin' on Heaven's door
    (Knock-knock-knockin' on Heaven's door)
    
    Knock-knock-knockin' on Heaven's door
    (Knock-knock-knockin' on Heaven's door)
    Knock-knock-knockin' on Heaven's door
    (Knock-knock-knockin' on Heaven's door)
    
    Knock-knock-knockin' on Heaven's door
    Knock-knock-knockin' on Heaven's door
    Knock-knock-knockin' on Heaven's door
    Knock-knock-knockin' on Heaven's door
