    [Couplet 1]
    Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
    Ain't got time to take a fast train
    Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home
    My baby, just a wrote me a letter
    
    [Couplet 2]
    I don't care how much money I gotta spend
    Got to get back to my baby again
    Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home
    My baby, just-a wrote me a letter
    
    [Refrain]
    Well, she wrote me a letter
    Said she couldn't live without me no more
    Listen mister, can't you see I got to get back
    To my baby once-a more
    Anyway, yeah
