  <pre><span class="structure">[Couplet 1]
</span>Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain&#39;t got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone, I&#39;m a-goin&#39; home
My baby, just a wrote me a letter

<span class="structure">[Couplet 2]
</span>I don&#39;t care how much money I gotta spend
Got to get back to my baby again
Lonely days are gone, I&#39;m a-goin&#39; home
My baby, just-a wrote me a letter

<span class="structure">[Refrain]
</span>Well, she wrote me a letter
Said she couldn&#39;t live without me no more
Listen mister, can&#39;t you see I got to get back
To my baby once-a more
Anyway, yeah

<span class="structure">[Couplet 3]
</span>Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain&#39;t got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone, I&#39;m a-goin&#39; home
My baby, just-a wrote me a letter

<span class="structure">[Refrain]
</span>Well, she wrote me a letter
Said she couldn&#39;t live without me no more
Listen mister, can&#39;t you see I got to get back
To my baby once-a more
Anyway, yeah

<span class="structure">[Couplet 4]
</span>Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain&#39;t got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone, I&#39;m a-goin&#39; home
My baby, just-a wrote me a letter,
My baby just-a wrote me a letter
