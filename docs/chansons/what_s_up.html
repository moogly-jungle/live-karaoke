  <h1>What&#39;s up - 4 Non Blondes</h1>
  
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXnxTNIWkc">YouTube</a>
  
  <pre>Twenty-five years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes
When I’m lying in bed
Just to get it all out
What’s in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs,
“What’s going on?!”

<span class="structure">[2x] And I say, “Hey, hey, hey, hey!”
</span>I said, “Hey, what’s going on?”
Ooh, ooh, ooh

And I try, oh, my God, do I try
I try all the time
In this institution
And I pray, oh, my God, do I pray
I pray every single day
For a revolution

And so I cry sometimes
When I’m lying in bed
Just to get it all out
What’s in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs,
“What’s going on?!”

<span class="structure">[4x] And I say, “Hey, hey, hey, hey!”
</span>I said, “Hey, what’s going on?”
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Twenty-five years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
