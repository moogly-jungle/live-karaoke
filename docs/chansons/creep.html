  <h1>Creep - RadioHead</h1>
  
    <a href="hthttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFkzRNyygfk">YouTube</a>
  
  <pre>When you were here before
Couldn&#39;t look you in the eyes
You&#39;re just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry

You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You&#39;re so fuckin&#39; special

But I&#39;m a creep
I&#39;m a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don&#39;t belong here

I don&#39;t care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul

I want you to notice
When I&#39;m not around
You&#39;re so fuckin&#39; special
I wish I was special

But I&#39;m a creep
I&#39;m a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don&#39;t belong here
Oh-ohh, oh-ohhh

She&#39;s running out the door
She&#39;s running out
She run, run, run
Ruuuuunnnnnn
Ruuuuunnnnnn

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You&#39;re so fuckin&#39; special
I wish I was special

But I&#39;m a creep
I&#39;m a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don&#39;t belong here
I don&#39;t belong here
