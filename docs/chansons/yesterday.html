    Yesterday
    All my troubles seemed so far away
    Now it looks as though they're here to stay
    Oh, I believe in yesterday
    
    Suddenly
    I'm not half the man I used to be
    There's a shadow hangin' over me
    Oh, yesterday came suddenly
    
    Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say
    I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
    
    Yesterday
    Love was such an easy game to play
    Now I need a place to hide away
    Oh, I believe in yesterday
    
    Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say
    I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
    
    Yesterday
    Love was such an easy game to play
    Now I need a place to hide away
    Oh, I believe in yesterday
    Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
