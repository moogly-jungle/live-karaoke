  <pre>Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they&#39;re here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly
I&#39;m not half the man I used to be
There&#39;s a shadow hangin&#39; over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go, I don&#39;t know, she wouldn&#39;t say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go, I don&#39;t know, she wouldn&#39;t say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
