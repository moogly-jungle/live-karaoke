  <h1>Blowin&#39;In The Wind - Bob Dylan</h1>
  
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwgrjjIMXA">YouTube</a>
  
  <pre>How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man
How many seas must the white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand

Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they are forever banned
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Before it washed to the sea
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they&#39;re allowed to be free

Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn&#39;t see
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry

Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
