  <pre>On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin&#39; to myself, &#34;This could be heaven or this could be hell&#34;
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say

&#34;Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year)
You can find it here&#34;

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes-Benz, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain, &#34;Please bring me my wine&#34;
He said, &#34;We haven&#39;t had that spirit here since 1969&#34;
And still, those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night just to hear them say

&#34;Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They&#39;re livin&#39; it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis&#34;

Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
And she said, &#34;We are all just prisoners here of our own device&#34;
And in the master&#39;s chambers, they gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can&#39;t kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
&#34;Relax, &#34; said the night man, &#34;We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave&#34;
