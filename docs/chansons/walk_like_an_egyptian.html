  <pre>All the old paintings on the tomb
They do the sand dance, don&#39;t you know?
If they move too quick (Oh-way-oh)
They&#39;re falling down like a domino
All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet
Gold crocodiles (Oh-way-oh)
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

Foreign types with the hookah pipes say
(Way-oh, way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)

Walk like an Egyptian

The blonde waitresses take their trays
They spin around, and they cross the floor
They&#39;ve got the moves (Oh-way-oh)
You drop your drink, then they bring you more
All the school kids so sick of books
They like the punk and the metal band
When the buzzer rings (Oh-way-oh)
They&#39;re walking like an Egyptian

All the kids in the marketplace say
(Way-oh, way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)

Walk like an Egyptian

Slide your feet up the street, bend your back
Shift your arm, then you pull it back
Life is hard, you know (Oh-way-oh)
So strike a pose on a Cadillac
If you want to find all the cops
They&#39;re hanging out in the donut shop
They sing and dance (Oh-way-oh)
They spin the clubs, cruise down the block
All the Japanese with their yen
The party boys call the Kremlin
And the Chinese know (Oh-way-oh)
They walk the line like Egyptian

All the cops in the donut shop say
(Way-oh, way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)

Walk like an Egyptian
Walk like an Egyptian
