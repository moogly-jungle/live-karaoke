</span>
<span class="structure">[Verse 1]
</span>When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we&#39;ll see
No, I won&#39;t be afraid
Oh, I won&#39;t be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

<span class="structure">[Chorus]
</span>So darlin&#39;, darlin&#39;, stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand
Stand by me, stand by me

<span class="structure">[Verse 2]
</span>If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won&#39;t cry, I won&#39;t cry
No, I won&#39;t shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

<span class="structure">[Chorus]
</span>And darlin&#39;, darlin&#39;, stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Woah, stand now
Stand by me, stand by me

<span class="structure">[Interlude]
</span>
<span class="structure">[Chorus]
</span>Darlin&#39;, darlin&#39;, stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now
Stand by me, stand by me

<span class="structure">[Outro]
</span>Whenever you&#39;re in trouble, won&#39;t you stand by me?
Oh, stand by me
Woah, just stand now
Oh, stand, stand by me
