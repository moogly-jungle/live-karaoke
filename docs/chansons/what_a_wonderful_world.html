  <h1>What A Wonderful World - Louis Armstrong</h1>

  <pre>I see trees of green
Red roses too
I see them bloom
For me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

I see skies of blue
And clouds of white
The bright blessed day
The dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
Of people going by
I see friends shaking hands
Saying, &#34;How do you do?&#34;
They&#39;re really saying
I love you

I hear babies cry
I watch them grow
They&#39;ll learn much more
Than I&#39;ll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Yes, I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Ooh, yes
