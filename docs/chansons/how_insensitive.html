    <!--LYRICS-->
    How insensitive
    I must have seemed
    When she told me that he loved me
    How unmoved and cold
    
    I must have seemed
    When she told me so sincerely
    Why she must have asked
    Did I just turn and stare in icy silence
    
    What was I to say
    What can you say when a love affair is over
    
    Now she's gone away
    And I'm alone with the memory of her last look
    Vague and drawn and sad
    I see it still
    
    All her heartbreak in that last look
    Why she must have asked
    Did I just stare in icy silence
    What was I to do
    What can one do when a love affair is over
