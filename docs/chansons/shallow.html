    Tell me something, girl
    Are you happy in this modern world?
    Or do you need more?
    Is there something else you're searchin' for?
    
    I'm falling
    In all the good times, I find myself longin' for change
    And in the bad times, I fear myself
    
    Tell me something, boy
    Aren't you tired trying to fill that void?
    Or do you need more?
    Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?
    
    I'm falling
    In all the good times, I find myself longing for change
    And in the bad times, I fear myself
    
    I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
    I'll never meet the ground
    Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
    We're far from the shallow now
    
    In the sha-, shallow
    In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-llow
    In the sha-ha, sha-ha-llow
    We're far from the shallow now
    
    Oh, ha-ah-ah
    Ah, ha-ah-ah, oh, ah
    Ha-ah-ah-ah
    
    I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
    I'll never meet the ground
    Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
    We're far from the shallow now
    
    In the sha-ha, sha-ha-llow
    In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-llow
    In the sha-ha, sha-ha-llow
    We're far from the shallow now
