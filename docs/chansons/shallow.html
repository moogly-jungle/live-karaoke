  <h1>Shallow - Lady Gaga</h1>

  <pre>Tell me something, girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there something else you&#39;re searchin&#39; for?

I&#39;m falling
In all the good times, I find myself longin&#39; for change
And in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren&#39;t you tired trying to fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain&#39;t it hard keeping it so hardcore?

I&#39;m falling
In all the good times, I find myself longing for change
And in the bad times, I fear myself

I&#39;m off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I&#39;ll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface, where they can&#39;t hurt us
We&#39;re far from the shallow now

In the sha-, shallow
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-llow
In the sha-ha, sha-ha-llow
We&#39;re far from the shallow now

Oh, ha-ah-ah
Ah, ha-ah-ah, oh, ah
Ha-ah-ah-ah

I&#39;m off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I&#39;ll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface, where they can&#39;t hurt us
We&#39;re far from the shallow now

In the sha-ha, sha-ha-llow
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-llow
In the sha-ha, sha-ha-llow
We&#39;re far from the shallow now
