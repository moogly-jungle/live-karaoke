Holly came from Miami, F-L-A
Hitch-hiked her way across the USA
Plucked her eyebrows along the way
Shaved her legs and then he was a she

She says, &#34;Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side&#34;
Said, &#34;Hey honey, take a walk on the wild side&#34;

Candy came from out on the Island
In the backroom, she was everybody&#39;s darling
But she never lost her head
Even when she was giving head

She says, &#34;Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side&#34;
Said, &#34;Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side&#34;

And the colored girls go
Doo, do-doo, do-doo, do-do-doo
Doo, do-doo, do-doo, do-do-doo
Doo, do-doo, do-doo, do-do-doo
Doo, do-doo, do-doo, do-do-doo
...

Little Joe never once gave it away
Everybody had to pay and pay
A hustle here and a hustle there
New York City is the place where they said

&#34;Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side&#34;
I said, &#34;Hey Joe, take a walk on the wild side&#34;

Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the streets
Looking for soul food and a place to eat
Went to the Apollo
You should&#39;ve seen him go, go, go

They said, &#34;Hey sugar, take a walk on the wild side&#34;
I said, &#34;Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side&#34;
Alright, huh

Jackie is just speeding away
Thought she was James Dean for a day
Then I guess she had to crash
Valium would&#39;ve helped that bash

She said, &#34;Hey, babe, take a walk on the wild side&#34;
I said, &#34;Hey, honey, take a walk on the wild side&#34;

And the colored girls say
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
