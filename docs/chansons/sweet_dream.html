    <!--LYRICS-->
    Sweet dreams are made of this
    Who am I to disagree ?
    I travel the world and the seven seas
    Everybody' s looking for something
    
    Some of them want to use you
    Some of them want to get used by you
    Some of them want to abuse you
    Some of them want to be abused
    
    Sweet dreams are made of this
    Who am I to disagree ?
    I travel the world and the seven seas
    Everybody' s looking for something
    
    Hold your head up
    Keep your head up, movin' on
    Hold your head up, movin' on
    Keep your head up, movin' on
    Hold your head up, movin' on
    Keep your head up, movin' on
    Hold your head up, movin' on
    Keep your head up
    
    Some of them want to use you
    Some of them want to get used by you
    Some of them want to abuse you
    Some of them want to be abused
    
    Hold your head up
    Keep your head up, movin' on
    Hold your head up, movin' on
    Keep your head up, movin' on
    Hold your head up, movin' on
    Keep your head up, movin' on
    Hold your head up, movin' on
    Keep your head up
    
    Sweet dreams are made of this
    Who am I to disagree ?
    I travel the world and the seven seas
