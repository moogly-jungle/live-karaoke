  <h1>You Never Can Tell - Chuck Berry</h1>

  <pre>It was a teenage wedding and the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre did truly love the Mademoiselle
And now the young Monsieur and Madame have rung the chapel bell
&#34;C&#39;est la vie&#34; say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

They furnished off an apartment with a two room roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale
But when Pierre found work, the little money comin&#39; worked out well
&#34;C&#39;est la vie&#34; say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

They had a hi-fi phono boy did they let it blast?
Seven hundred little records all rock, rhythm, and jazz
But when the sun went down the rapid tempo of the music fell
&#34;C&#39;est la vie&#34; say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

They bought a souped-up jitney was a cherry red &#39;53
And drove it down New Orleans to celebrate their anniversary
It was there where Pierre was wedded to the lovely Mademoiselle
&#34;C&#39;est la vie&#34; say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

They had a teenage wedding and the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre did truly love the Mademoiselle
And now the young Monsieur and Madame have rung the chapel bell
&#34;C&#39;est la vie&#34; say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
