    <!--LYRICS-->
    I put a spell on you
    Because you're mine
    
    You better stop the things you do
    I tell you, I ain't lying
    I ain't lying
    
    You know I can't stand it
    You're running around
    You know better, daddy
    I can't stand it 'cause you put me down
    Oh, no
    
    [Instrumental, 8 mesures]
    .... .... .... ....
    .... .... .... ....
    
    You know I can't stand it
    You're running around
    You know better, daddy
    I can't stand it 'cause you put me down
    Oh, no
    
    I put a spell on you
    Because you're mine
    
    [piano : 2 mesures]
    .... ....
    
    You know I love you
    I love you
    I love you
    I love you anyhow
    And I don't care
    If you don't want me
    I'm yours right now
    
    I put a spell on you
    Because you're mine
    
    You know I can't stand it
    You're running around
    You know better, daddy
    I can't stand it 'cause you put me down
    Ooh-hoo-ooh
    
    I put a spell on you
    Because you're mine
    Because you're mine
    Because you're mine
    
    Oh
    Yeah
