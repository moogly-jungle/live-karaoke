    <!--LYRICS-->
    Tall and tan and young and lovely
    The girl from Ipanema goes walking
    And when she passes
    Each one she passes goes
    
    When she walks, she's like a samba
    That swings so cool and sways so gentle
    That when she passes
    Each one she passes goes - ooh
    
    (Ooh) But I watch her so sadly
    How can I tell her I love her
    Yes I would give my heart gladly
    But each day, when she walks to the sea
    She looks straight ahead, not at me
    
    Tall, (and) tan, (and) young, (and) lovely
    The girl from Ipanema goes walking
    And when she passes, I smile
    But she doesn't see (doesn't see)
    (She just doesn't see, she never sees me, ...)
