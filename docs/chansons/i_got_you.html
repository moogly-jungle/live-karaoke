Wow, I feel good
I knew that I would now
I feel good
I knew that I would now
So good, so good, I got you

Wow, I feel nice
Like sugar and spice
I feel nice
Like sugar and spice
So nice, so nice, I got you

When I hold you in my arms
I know that I can do no wrong
And when I hold you in my arms
My love won&#39;t do you no harm
And I feel nice

Like sugar and spice
I feel nice
Like sugar and spice
So nice, so nice, I got you
When I hold you in my arms

I know that I can&#39;t do no wrong
And when I hold you in my arms
My love can&#39;t do me no harm
And I feel nice
Like sugar and spice

I feel nice
Like sugar and spice
So nice, so nice, well I got you
Wow, I feel good
I knew that I would now

I feel good
I knew that I would
So good, so good, &#39;cause I got you
So good, so good, &#39;cause I got you
So good, so good, &#39;cause I got you

Hey
