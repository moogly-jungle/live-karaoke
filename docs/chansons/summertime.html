    <!--LYRICS-->
    Summertime,
    And the livin' is easy
    Fish are jumpin'
    And the cotton is high
    
    Your daddy's rich
    And your mammy's good lookin'
    So hush little baby
    Don't you cry
    
    One of these morning
    You're going to rise up singing
    Then you'll spread your wings
    And you'll take to the sky
    
    But till that morning
    There's a'nothing can harm you
    With daddy and mammy standing by
    
    Summertime,
    And the livin' is so easy
    Fish are jumpin'
    And the cotton is high
    
    Your daddy's rich
    And your mammy's good lookin'
    So hush little baby
    Don't you cry
