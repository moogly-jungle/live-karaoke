  <h1>Summertime - George Gershwin</h1>

  <pre>Summertime,
And the livin&#39; is easy
Fish are jumpin&#39;
And the cotton is high

Your daddy&#39;s rich
And your mammy&#39;s good lookin&#39;
So hush little baby
Don&#39;t you cry

One of these morning
You&#39;re going to rise up singing
Then you&#39;ll spread your wings
And you&#39;ll take to the sky

But till that morning
There&#39;s a&#39;nothing can harm you
With daddy and mammy standing by

Summertime,
And the livin&#39; is so easy
Fish are jumpin&#39;
And the cotton is high

Your daddy&#39;s rich
And your mammy&#39;s good lookin&#39;
So hush little baby
Don&#39;t you cry
