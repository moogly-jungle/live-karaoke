I put a spell on you
Because you&#39;re mine

You better stop the things you do
I tell you, I ain&#39;t lying
I ain&#39;t lying

You know I can&#39;t stand it
You&#39;re running around
You know better, daddy
I can&#39;t stand it &#39;cause you put me down
Oh, no

[Instrumental, 8 mesures]
.... .... .... ....
.... .... .... ....

You know I can&#39;t stand it
You&#39;re running around
You know better, daddy
I can&#39;t stand it &#39;cause you put me down
Oh, no

I put a spell on you
Because you&#39;re mine

[piano : 2 mesures]
.... ....

You know I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you anyhow
And I don&#39;t care
If you don&#39;t want me
I&#39;m yours right now

I put a spell on you
Because you&#39;re mine

You know I can&#39;t stand it
You&#39;re running around
You know better, daddy
I can&#39;t stand it &#39;cause you put me down
Ooh-hoo-ooh

I put a spell on you
Because you&#39;re mine
Because you&#39;re mine
Because you&#39;re mine

Oh
Yeah
