Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating?
Do you understand? Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Is this burning an eternal flame?

I believe it&#39;s meant to be, darling
I watch you when you are sleeping
You belong with me
Do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming?
Or is this burning (burning) an eternal flame?

Say my name
Sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
And then come and ease the pain
I don&#39;t want to lose this feeling, oh

[interlude]

Say my name
Sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
And then come and ease the pain
I don&#39;t want to lose this feeling, oh

Close your eyes, give me your hand
Do you feel my heart beating?
Do you understand? Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Or is this burning an eternal flame?

Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating?
Do you understand? Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Is this burning an eternal flame?

Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating?
Do you understand? Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Oh (an eternal flame)

Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating?
Do you understand? Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Is this burning an eternal flame?
Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling
