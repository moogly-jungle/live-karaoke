  <pre>You&#39;re killin&#39; me baby with the things you do
Put me in the ground before we&#39;re through
Burnin&#39; up this town
Spendin&#39; everythin&#39; I&#39;ve saved
Yeah
You&#39;ve been out all night
Diggin&#39; my grave

Every little lie you tell can&#39;t keep it hid
You&#39;re just another nail on the coffin lid
Someone else is gettin&#39; all the love you never gave
Woo (Yeah)
And you&#39;ve been out all night
Diggin&#39; my grave, yeah

So keep on runnin&#39; &#39;round
Ain&#39;t no need to hurry back
&#39;Cause I&#39;ll be gone from here
And you&#39;ll be all dressed up in black

Six feet under baby that&#39;s where I&#39;ll be
By the time that you&#39;re done with me
All these tears I cry
Drownin&#39; in a tidal wave

You&#39;ve been out all night
Diggin&#39; my grave

So keep on runnin&#39; around
Ain&#39;t no need to hurry back
&#39;Cause I&#39;ll be gone from here
And you&#39;ll be all dressed up in black
Woo

Six feet under baby that&#39;s where I&#39;ll be
By the time that you&#39;re done with me
All these tears I cry
Drownin&#39; in a tidal wave
Yeah, yeah

You&#39;ve been out all night
Diggin&#39; my grave
You&#39;ve been out all night
Diggin&#39; my grave

Diggin&#39; my, diggin&#39; my, diggin&#39; my
Diggin&#39; my, diggin&#39; my, diggin&#39; my
Diggin&#39; my, diggin&#39; my, diggin&#39; my grave
Diggin&#39; my, diggin&#39; my, diggin&#39; my
Diggin&#39; my, diggin&#39; my, diggin&#39; my
Diggin&#39; my, diggin&#39; my, diggin&#39; my grave
