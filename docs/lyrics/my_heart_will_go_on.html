  <pre>Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on

Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more, you open the door
And you&#39;re here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go &#39;til we&#39;re gone

Love was when I loved you
One true time I&#39;d hold to
In my life, we&#39;ll always go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on (why does the heart go on?)
Once more, you open the door
And you&#39;re here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

You&#39;re here, there&#39;s nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on
We&#39;ll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart and
My heart will go on and on
