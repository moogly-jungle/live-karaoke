Mama take this badge from me
I can&#39;t use it anymore
It&#39;s getting dark too dark to see
Feels like I&#39;m knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door

Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door
Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door
Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door
Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door

Mama put my guns in the ground
I can&#39;t shoot them anymore
That cold black cloud is comin&#39; down
Feels like I&#39;m knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door

Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door
Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door
Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door
Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door

&#34;You just better start sniffin&#39; your own rank subjugation jack
&#39;Cause it&#39;s just you against your tattered libido
The bank and the mortician, forever man
And it wouldn&#39;t be luck if you could get out of life alive&#34;

Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door
(Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door)
Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door
(Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door)

Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door
(Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door)
Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door
(Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door)

Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door
Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door
Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door
Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s door
