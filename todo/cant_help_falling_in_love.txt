titre: Can't Help Falling In Love
artiste: Elvis Presley
paroles:
Wise men say, only fools rush in   
but I can't help, falling in love with you
Shall I stay, would it be a sin     
If I can't help, falling in love with you

Like a river flows, surely to the sea
darling so it goes
some things are meant to be

Take my hand, take my whole life too
for I can't help, falling in love with you

Like a river flows, surely to the sea
darling so it goes
some things are meant to be

Take my hand, take my whole life too
for I can't help, falling in love with you
