paroles:
[Verse 1]
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby

[Verse 2]
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

[Bridge]
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

[Verse 3]
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then, oh, why can't I?

[Outro]
If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh, why can't I?
