paroles:
Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel

It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life, for me
And I'm feeling good
I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River running free, you know how I feel
Blossom on a tree, you know how I feel

It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life, for me
And I'm feeling good

Dragonfly out in the sun
You know what I mean, don't you know?
Butterflies all havin' fun
You know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done, that’s what I mean

And this old world is a new world
And a bold world, for me
For me!

Stars, when you shine, you know how I feel
Scent of the pine, you know how I feel
Oh, freedom is mine, and I know how I feel

It's a new dawn, it’s a new day
It's a new life
It's a new dawn, it’s a new day
It's a new life
It's a new dawn, it’s a new day
It's a new life
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

[Outro]
I'm feeling good
I feel so good
I feel so good
