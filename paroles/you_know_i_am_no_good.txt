paroles:
Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, "What did you do it with him today?"
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray

Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you, I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Upstairs in bed with my ex boy
Heâ€™s in the place but I can't get joy
Thinking of you in the final throes 
This is when my buzzer goes

Run out to meet you, chips and Pita
You say "When we're married" cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you, I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

[Chorus]

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, You on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet

Then you notice little carpet burn 
My stomach drops and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst 
to truly stuck the knife in first

I cheated myself like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble, you know that I'm no good
I cheated myself, like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble, yeah, You know that I'm no good
