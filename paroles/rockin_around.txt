paroles:

[Couplet 1]
Rocking around the Christmas tree
at the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
every couple tries to stop

[Couplet 2]
Rocking around the Christmas tree,
let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
and we'll do some caroling


[Pont]
You will get a sentimental feeling
when you hear
Voices singing let's be jolly,
deck the halls with boughs of holly


[Couplet 3]
Rocking around the Christmas tree,
have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily
in the new old-fashioned way

[Solo Sax]

[Pont]
You will get a sentimental feeling
when you hear
Voices singing let's be jolly,
deck the halls with boughs of holly

[Couplet 4]
Rocking around the Christmas tree,
have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily
in the new old-fashioned way

Everyone dancing merrily
in the new   old - fa - shioned way
