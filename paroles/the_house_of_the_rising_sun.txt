paroles:
There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
Dear God, I know I was one

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
And my father was a gamblin' man
Way down in New Orleans

And the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's a drunk

Oh, mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
To spend your lives in sin and misery
In the house of the rising sun

I got one foot on the platform
And another on the train
And I'm going back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

[Instrumental]

There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
Dear God, I know I was one
Dear God, I know I was the one
