paroles:
At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Thinking I could live without you by my side
And after spending nights
Thinking how you did me wrong
I grew strong
And I learned how to get along

Now you're back
From outer space
And I find you here
With that sad look upon your face
I should've changed that stupid lock
Or made you leave your key
If I'd've known for a second
You'd be back to bother me

Go on, go, walk out the door
Turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
You're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Think I'd crumble?
You think I'd lay down and die?

No, not I, I will survive
Long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got my life to live
And all my love to give and
I will survive
I, I, I will survive

It took all my strength not to fall apart
Trying with all my might to mend my broken heart
I spent so many nights feeling sorry for myself
How I cried
But now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that lonely little person
Still in love with you
Now you come droppin' in
Expectin' me to be free
Now I'm saving my lovin'
For someone who's loving me

Go on and go, walk out the door
Turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
You're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Thinkin' I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

No, not I, I will survive
Long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got my life to live, and all my love to give
And I will survive
I, I will survive

Go on, go, walk out the door
Turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
You're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Think I'd crumble?
You think I'd lay down and die?

No, not I, I will survive
Long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got my life to live
And all my love to give and
I will survive
I, I, I will survive
