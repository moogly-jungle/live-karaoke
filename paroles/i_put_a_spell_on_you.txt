paroles:
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine

You better stop the things you do
I tell you, I ain't lying
I ain't lying

You know I can't stand it
You're running around
You know better, daddy
I can't stand it 'cause you put me down
Oh, no

[Instrumental, 8 mesures]
.... .... .... ....

You know I can't stand it
You're running around
You know better, daddy
I can't stand it 'cause you put me down
Oh, no

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine

[piano : 2 mesures]
.... ....

You know I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you anyhow
And I don't care
If you don't want me
I'm yours right now

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine

You know I can't stand it
You're running around
You know better, daddy
I can't stand it 'cause you put me down
Ooh-hoo-ooh

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
Because you're mine
Because you're mine

Oh
Yeah
