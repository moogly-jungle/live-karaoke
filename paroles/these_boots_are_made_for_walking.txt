paroles:
You keep saying you got something for me
Something you call love, but confess
You've been a messin' where you shouldn't have been a messin'
And now someone else is getting all your best

These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days, these boots are gonna walk all over you

Yeah

You keep lyin' when you ought to be truthin'
You keep losin' when you ought to not bet
You keep samin' when you ought to be a changin'
Now what's right is right, but you ain't been right yet

These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days, these boots are gonna walk all over you

You keep playin' where you shouldn't be playin'
And you keep thinking that you'll never get burnt, ha
I've just found me a brand new box of matches, yeah
And what he knows you ain't had time to learn

These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days, these boots are gonna walk all over you

Are you ready, boots?
Start walking
