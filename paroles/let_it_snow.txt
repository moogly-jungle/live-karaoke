paroles:
[Couplet 1]
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Couplet 2]
Man, it doesn't show signs of stoppin'
And I've brought me some corn for poppin'
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow

[Refrain]
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate goin' out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home, I'll be warm

[Couplet 3]
And the fire is slowly dyin'
And, my dear, we're still goodbyein'
But as long as you'd love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow

[Instrumental]

[Refrain]
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate goin' out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home, I'll be warm

[Couplet 3]
Oh, the fire is slowly dyin'
And, my dear, we're still goodbyein'
But as long as you'd love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
