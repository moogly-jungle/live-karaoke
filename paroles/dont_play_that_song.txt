paroles:
[Verse 1]
Don't play that song for me
'Cause it brings back memories
Of days that I once knew
The days that I spent with you
Oh, no, don't let them play it (Oh, no)
It fills my heart with pain (It hurts)
Please stop it right away
'Cause I remember just a' what he said

[Chorus]
He said, darling (Darling I, I love you)
And I know that he lied (Darling I, I love you)
You know that you lied (Darling I, I love you)
You know that you lied (You lied), lied (You lied), you lied (To me)
Hey, mister, don't play it no more
Don't play it no more, I can't stand it
Don't play it no more (No more), no more (No more), no more (Can't stand it)

[Verse 2]
I remember on our first date
He kissed me and he walked away
I was only seventeen
I never dreamed he'd be so mean

[Chorus]
He told me darling (Darling, I love you)
Baby, baby, you lied (Darling, I need you)
You, you lied (Darling, I love you)
You know that you lied (You lied), lied (You lied), lied, lied, lied
(To me)

[Outro]
Oh oh oh, darling (Darling, I love you)
You know that you lied, yeah (Darling, I need you)
You know I know you lied (Darling, I love you)
Darling, you lied (You lied), you lied (You lied), you lied, you're all that I need, you lied (To me)
Oh oh oh, you lied (Don't play it no more)

Hey, baby, don't play it no more (Woah oh oh, don't play it no more)
Don't do it. Don't play it no more (Woah oh oh, for me)
No more (For me)
I can't stand it no more (Don't play it no more)
Oh hey don't play it no more (Woah oh oh, don't play it no more)
