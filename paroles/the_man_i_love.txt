paroles:
[Verse 1]
Someday he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

[Verse 2]
He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

[Bridge]
Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

[Verse 3]
He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would? Would you?
And so all else above
I'm waiting for the man I love

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would? Would you?
And so all else above
I'm waiting for the man I love
